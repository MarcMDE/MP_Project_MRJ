- Simetric methods on AABB and CircleCollider. (AABB-CircleCollider coll + CircleCollider-AABB coll returns an error) --> Due to 
circular including (include AABB on CircleCollider and CircleCollider on AABB) we commented the CircleCollider "redundance"	

- Destructor call destructor call ("nested classed") --> Check Anim2D Destructor
